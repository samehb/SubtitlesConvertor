# SubtitlesConverter
## Introduction
SubtitlesConverter allows you to convert your Arabic subtitles so they can be used with systems that do not support Arabic. It supports SubRip (*.srt) and MicroDVD (*.sub) subtitles. The project was originally developed to be used with the SMS Player. Though, it can work with other projects. SubtitlesConverter is based on the [Arabization](https://github.com/samehb/Arabization) project.

## How to Use

1. After executing the program, select the Arabic subtitles input file. You can get the subtitles files from any subtitles hosting websites.
2. Select the output file name.
3. Click Convert and you are done with the conversion part.
4. Place the new converted subtitles files with the videos.

If you are using this for the SMS Player for PS2, you need to find a way to copy the files from the [Fonts](Fonts) folder into your memory card. If you do not know how, simply follow this [guide](http://bootleg.sksapps.com/tutorials/fmcb/noobie.php) to install Free McBoot while adding the uLaunchELF application to it. Put the files in [Fonts](Font) on a USB drive then plug it into your PS2. Launch uLaunchELF from the PS2 Main menu and go to your drive (mass:) and navigate to the files you added, then copy them. Move out to the main menu and head to mc0: then go inside the SMS folder and paste the files. That is it. The [Fonts](Fonts) folder also includes SMS.lng. This file will allow the SMS Player to display Arabic menus. If you do not want Arabic menus, do not add it.

If you are using the SubtitlesConverter for other projects they will tell you how to place the fonts. That is all there is to it.
